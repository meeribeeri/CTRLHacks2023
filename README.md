# CTRLHacks2023
Meeribeeri & llnotion's submission to CTRL-Hacks 2023. (Alex Ngo (SWC) & Grayson Ardron (Crescent Heights))

Coded in Python using Tkinter

A game where you answer questions based on various things in Social Studies, Math, and ELA to damage and defeat your opponent. It is a 2 player game. By being a game, players will be more encouraged to actually study and learn what the questions are asking about, rather than reading from a textbook. This aids in the learning and studying process.
Idea for this game was partly based on Library of Ruina... barely... honestly it is pretty much just the card aspect. Most of the game was built on whatever was easiest to do during coding.
llnotion helped with brainstorming and coming up with the idea and getting a start with Tkinter(helping Meeribeeri learn it since they had never done it before), Meeribeeri did most of the coding, and drawing.

To run: Download the dist folder and run the executable.
